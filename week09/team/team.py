# TODO: Fix the recursive code so that it can find your house. Your house has a value of -2.

# Definitions:
# - A neighborhood is a two-dimensional array (2 x 2 grid) of integers. The size of neighborhood
#   is defined by the global SIZE variable.
# - An even value is a house, an odd value is a street (pathway through the neighborhood).
# - A house is a particular location in the neighborhood, so a coordinate (row, col).
# - Your house will always be in the last row at a random column (with a value of -2).

# Pseudocode (steps of how it works):
# 1. In recursive function, check if a house (row, col) in the neighborhood is your house
#    (equals -2). If it is, return True.
# 2. Determine if you have already checked this house (row, col): if True, return False
# 3. Add house to solution path (list)
# 4. Recursively check the next column and current row if house (row, next_col) is even
# 5. Recursively check the current column and next row if house (next_row, col) is even
# 6. If the recursive call returns True, return True again to exit; else remove
#    house from solution path


# Size of the neighborhood (SIZE x SIZE)
SIZE = 15

# Proven algorithm (so modify at your own discretion/peril)


def get_even_paths(row: int, col: int, neighborhood):
    even_paths = []
    # Move to the right, -1 indicates out of bounds
    next_col = col + 1 if col + 1 < SIZE else -1
    # Move down a row, -1 indicates out of bounds
    next_row = row + 1 if row + 1 < SIZE else -1

    # Is value in next column and current row even
    if next_col != -1 and neighborhood[row][next_col] % 2 == 0:
        #print(f'adding next_col: {row},{next_col}, value={map[row][next_col]}')
        even_paths.append((row, next_col))

    # Is value in current column and next row even
    if next_row != -1 and neighborhood[next_row][col] % 2 == 0:
        #print(f'adding next_row: {next_row},{col}, value={map[next_row][col]}')

    # Check if this house is your house

    # Create list to store any path that contains an even value

        # Add to path before checking if r and c are on the solution path since
        # if we find the house, we will return out of function

        # If this r and c are the house, then exit by returning

        # Since we returned False from recursive call, we know we didn't find the house
        # so can remove the r and c from the solution path

        # remove this, just here to prevent compiler from complaining
