All ASSERTS must pass. Everything in this assignment should have been learned
previously. If there are holes in your knowledge, then this is the time to 
fill them (meaning learn the concepts). Take the time to learn by reading
the provided links. There are no group "prove" assignments in this class.

Make sure to write comments above your functions, explaining in your own
words what the functions does. Your comments are your "digital signature",
showing that you both wrote the code and understand how it works.

Grading:
Missing comments: 0 points (assignment will not be graded) -true for all prove assignments
Not passing an assert or answering #10 and #12: 0 points (code must pass all asserts--this is only true of this first assignment)

#      12) TODO: What does immutable mean?

# Don't change any of the assert lines. All asserts should pass. You should see "All tests passed!" if all assert pass.
# If an assert doesn't pass, you will see an AssertionError (see https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp).
