Need to review/relearn all the "Know how to" statements:                8+ hours

All ASSERTS must pass. Everything in this assignment should have been learned
previously. If there are holes in your knowledge, then this is the time to 
fill them (meaning learn the concepts). Take the time to learn by reading
the provided links. There are no group "prove" assignments in this class.

Make sure to write comments above your functions, explaining in your own
words what the functions does. Your comments are your "digital signature",
showing that you both wrote the code and understand how it works.

Grading:
Missing comments: 0 points (assignment will not be graded) -true for all prove assignments
Not passing an assert or answering #10 and #12: 0 points (code must pass all asserts--this is only true of this first assignment)

# 1) TODO write a function called 'perform_math' that takes three parameters:
#      - initial_value: int
#      - value: int
#      - operation: str
#      - return value: float
#      The function should perform the mathematical operation, represented
#      by the string operation parameter, on the initial_value and value.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 2) TODO write a function called 'find_word_index' that takes two parameters:
#      - word_to_find: str
#      - words: list
#      - return value: int
#      The function should return the index value of the word_to_find in the words list.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 3) TODO write a function called 'get_value_from_dict_using_key' that takes two parameters:
#      - key: str
#      - word_dict: dict
#      - return value: str
#      The function should return the value (which will be a string) mapped to the key.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 4) TODO write a function called 'get_list_of_urls_from_dict' that takes two parameters:
#      - key: str
#      - url_dict: dict
#      - return value: list
#      The function should return the value (which will be a list) mapped to the key.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 5) TODO write a function called 'find_url' that takes two parameters:
#      - urls: list
#      - name: str
#      - return value: str
#      The function should return the url that contains the name within a list of urls,
#      else return a blank string.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 6) TODO write a function called 'find_str_in_file' that takes two parameters:
#      - filename: str
#      - str_to_find: str
#      - return value: bool
#      The function should return true if str_to_find is within the file, else false
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 7) TODO write a class called 'MyParentClass'. The constructor should take three parameters:
#      - value: int
#      - values: list
#      - name: str
#      Add a method called 'get_value_using_index' that returns the value
#      in the values list at an index that is passed.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 8) TODO write a class called 'MyChildClass'. The class should extend the MyParentClass.
#      The constructor should take four parameters:
#      - value: int
#      - values: list
#      - name: str
#      - age: int
#      The constructor should call super and pass in the appropriate parameters
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.

# 9) TODO write a function called 'pass_by_reference_mutable_example' that takes two parameters:
#      - lists_are_passed_by_reference_and_mutable: list
#      - str_to_add: str
#      - return value: str
#      The function should append the str_to_add to the list and return index zero. Notice that in the asserts,
#      that the memory id of the list stays the same after adding the string. Also, the function
#      does not need to return the list in order for it to see the newly added item. Since the function
#      needs to return a string, you can make changes to a list without needing to return it from a function.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.
#      10) TODO: Provide a quick explanation of what pass-by-reference means. Also, what does mutable mean?

# 11) TODO write a function called 'pass_by_reference_immutable_example' that takes two parameters:
#      - strings_are_pass_by_reference_and_immutable: string
#      - str_to_add: str
#      - return value: str
#      The function should append the str_to_add to the strings_are_pass_by_reference_and_immutable string.
#      Notice that in the asserts, that the memory id of the first string and the return string are different.
#      Delete these instructions and replace with your own description of that the function does.
#      12) TODO: What does immutable mean?

# Don't change any of the assert lines. All asserts should pass. You should see "All tests passed!" if all assert pass.
# If an assert doesn't pass, you will see an AssertionError (see https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_assert.asp).
# The AssertionError will show you why it didn't pass (meaning, it is not an error with the assertion code, but with your code)
